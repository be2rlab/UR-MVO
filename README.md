## Introduction

UR-MVO is a robust monocular visual odometry pipeline designed specifically for underwater environments. Leveraging cutting-edge techniques such as SuperPoint for feature extraction and SuperGlue for feature matching, UR-MVO offers enhanced performance and reliability in underwater navigation tasks. Additionally, we incorporate semantic segmentation to improve the robustness of feature extraction, effectively filtering out features associated with dynamic objects or background clutter.
