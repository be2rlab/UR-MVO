# UR-MVO
Underwater Robust - Monocular Visual Odometry

## Introduction:
We propose UR-MVO a robust monocular visual odometry pipeline tailored for underwater scenarios with feature extraction and matching based on SuperPoint and SuperGlue respectively. 
We enhance robustness of the feature extractor through fine-tuning and integrating semantic segmentation to filter out features belonging to dynamic objects or background.
